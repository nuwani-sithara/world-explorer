Countries App - Iâ€™ve developed a dynamic frontend application using React that integrates seamlessly with the REST Countries API. This project highlights my skills in modern web development, API integration, and responsive design, delivering an interactive and user-friendly experience.  

ðŸ”¹ Key Features:
Comprehensive Country Data: Fetches and displays details like name, population, region, languages, capital, and flags using multiple API endpoints.  
Search & Filter Functionality: Users can search countries by name and filter by region or language, with real-time updates.  
Responsive Design: Built with Tailwind CSS (or your chosen framework) for a sleek, mobile-friendly interface.  
Optional User Authentication: Added login functionality to enable personalized features like saving favorite countries (if implemented).  
Thorough Testing: Implemented unit and integration tests using **Jest and React Testing Library** to ensure reliability.  

ðŸ”¹ Technical Highlights:
âœ” React Functional Components & Hooks: Leveraged modern React practices for clean, maintainable code.  
âœ” REST Countries API Integration: Utilized 4+ endpoints to fetch and display data dynamically.  
âœ” Git Best Practices: Maintained a well-documented commit history for version control.  
âœ” Deployment: Hosted on Vercel for live access.  

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
